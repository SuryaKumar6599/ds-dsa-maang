# ROADMAP — ds-dsa-maang

This roadmap outlines the planned evolution of **ds-dsa-maang** into the
most practical, high-signal **Data Scientist coding interview repository**
for MAANG and product-based companies.

---

## 🎯 Vision

Build a **curated, noise-free, DS-first** repository that:
- Reflects *real* Data Scientist interview expectations
- Avoids SDE-style DSA overkill
- Emphasizes clarity, patterns, and real-world data relevance
- Becomes a go-to reference for DS interview preparation

---

## ✅ Phase 1 — Foundation (Completed)

- [x] Clear repo structure (problems / solutions / patterns)
- [x] Company-wise problem organization
- [x] Python-only, clean solution standards
- [x] Pattern-based learning approach
- [x] README, CONTRIBUTING, LICENSE, CODE OF CONDUCT
- [x] Initial high-quality problem set (Easy–Medium)

---

## 🚧 Phase 2 — Expansion (Next)

### 📌 Problems
- [ ] Add more **SQL + Python hybrid** problems (StrataScratch, LeetCode SQL)
- [ ] Add **time-series & rolling metrics** problems
- [ ] Add **sampling & probability** interview questions
- [ ] Add **feature engineering–style** coding tasks

### 📌 Patterns
- [ ] Prefix Sum / Difference Array
- [ ] Rolling Window Metrics
- [ ] Data Bucketing & Binning
- [ ] Online Algorithms (Streaming data)
- [ ] Approximation Algorithms (Bloom filter, sketches)

---

## 🚀 Phase 3 — Advanced DS Focus

- [ ] Case-style coding problems (metric computation, experiment analysis)
- [ ] A/B testing logic via simulation
- [ ] Handling skewed data & outliers
- [ ] Memory-efficient large-scale data processing patterns
- [ ] Vectorized vs loop-based performance comparisons

---

## 🧪 Phase 4 — Tooling & Quality

- [ ] Add `pytest` test suite
- [ ] CI pipeline (GitHub Actions)
- [ ] Linting & formatting enforcement
- [ ] Performance benchmarks for selected problems
- [ ] Jupyter notebook walkthroughs

---

## 🌍 Phase 5 — Community & Reach

- [ ] Issue templates (new problem / improvement)
- [ ] Good First Issue labels
- [ ] Contributor leaderboard
- [ ] Blog / Medium / Notion companion
- [ ] Interview experience write-ups from contributors

---

## 🧭 Guiding Principles (Non-Negotiable)

- ❌ No competitive programming tricks
- ❌ No advanced graph / DP grind
- ✅ Strong DS relevance
- ✅ Clear interview explanation
- ✅ Readable, reusable Python code
- ✅ Pattern-first learning

---

## 🤝 How You Can Help

- Add problems that *you actually saw* in DS interviews
- Improve explanations from a DS perspective
- Contribute SQL-heavy or analytics-driven problems
- Suggest better patterns or abstractions

---

## ⭐ Final Goal

Make **ds-dsa-maang** the **most trusted open-source resource**
for **Data Scientists preparing for MAANG interviews**.

Quality > Quantity. Always.
