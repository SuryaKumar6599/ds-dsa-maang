## 🧠 How to Learn from This Repository

This repository is organized into **four learning layers**:

| Layer | Purpose |
|------|--------|
| `basics/` | Learn core DS & DSA concepts visually |
| `ds_structures/` | Python implementations with animations |
| `patterns/` | Abstract problem-solving patterns |
| `solutions/` | Interview-ready problem solutions |

### Recommended Learning Path
1. Read the relevant file in `basics/`
2. Run the Python visualization in `ds_structures/`
3. Understand the pattern in `patterns/`
4. Solve the problem in `solutions/`
