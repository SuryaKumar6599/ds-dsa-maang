# Probability Simulation

Use random sampling to approximate probabilistic outcomes.

## When to Use
- Analytical solution is hard
- Validation of probabilistic models

## Core Idea
Repeated random trials converge to expected values.

## Common DS Use Cases
- A/B testing
- Risk modeling
- Monte Carlo methods
