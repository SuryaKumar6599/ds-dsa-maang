# Sliding Window

Use this pattern for problems involving **contiguous subarrays or substrings**.

## When to Use
- Fixed or variable window problems
- Time-series analysis
- Streaming data constraints

## Core Idea
Move two pointers to expand and shrink a window while maintaining constraints.

## Common DS Use Cases
- Rolling averages
- Session-level metrics
- Real-time monitoring
