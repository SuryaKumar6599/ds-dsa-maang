# Arrays (Foundation)

## What Is an Array?
A **contiguous collection** of elements accessed by index.

```
Index:  0   1   2   3
Value: [5, 10, 15, 20]
```

## Why DS Care
- Time-series
- Feature vectors
- Metrics lists
- Sliding windows

## Key Properties
| Operation | Time |
|---------|------|
Access     | O(1)
Search     | O(n)
Insert     | O(n)

Arrays are **fast for access**, slow for insertion.

Used in:
- Sliding window
- Prefix sums
- Two pointers
