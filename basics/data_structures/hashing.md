# Hashing (Dictionary / Set)

## Core Idea
Map **keys → values** with near constant-time lookup.

```
"user_id" → count
```

## Why DS Care
- Counting events
- GroupBy logic
- De-duplication
- Feature encoding

## Complexity
| Operation | Avg |
|--------|----|
Insert | O(1)
Lookup | O(1)

Used in:
- Two Sum
- Group Anagrams
- Frequency problems
